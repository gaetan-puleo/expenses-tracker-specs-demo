**Overview**
A feature that allows users to create new expense entries by providing expense details such as amount, description, category, and date. The expense data is handled through a fake gateway interface for testing and development purposes.

**Sequence**
User Input › Validation › Dispatch Create Action › Fake Gateway Call › Success/Error Handling › State Update › UI Update

**Flow Description**
1. User fills out expense form with required details (amount, description, category, date)
2. Form validation ensures all required fields are provided and amount is valid
3. createExpense use case is dispatched with expense input data
4. Use case calls the fake expenses gateway to simulate expense creation
5. Fake gateway returns success response with created expense data or validation error
6. On success, expense is added to state and user sees confirmation
7. On error, error state is updated and user sees error message
8. Loading states are managed throughout the process

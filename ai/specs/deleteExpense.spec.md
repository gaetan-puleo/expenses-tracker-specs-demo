## Overview
Feature that allows users to delete an existing expense from the system. The feature handles the deletion process with proper loading states, error handling, and updates the application state to reflect the removal.

## Sequence
User triggers deletion › deleteExpense use case starts › Loading state activated › Gateway processes deletion › Success/Error state updated › UI reflects changes

## Flow Description
1. User initiates expense deletion with expense ID
2. Delete expense use case dispatches loading action
3. Gateway processes the deletion request
4. On success, dispatches success action and removes expense from state
5. On error, dispatches error action with appropriate error handling
6. UI updates to reflect the current state (loading, success, or error)
